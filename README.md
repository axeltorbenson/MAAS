# MAAS (Martial Arts Arbitrating with Statistics)

This repo is a work in progress that scrapes and judges MMA fights purely on their statistics and data.

Current scraping functions work, but would take about 5 or 6 hours to run and scrape all 1-2k pages. Also very unsafe, can't save data, etc. Going to switch to Scrappy, go async and make robust.
